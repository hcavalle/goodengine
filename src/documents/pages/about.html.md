  **I am a software and tech generalist**. From desktop support to systems admin and web development to hadoop, I've seen and done it. I am dedicated to effecting social good through business, tech and engineering. My past work as an engineer at SPINS.com, Destinilocators.com and Crowdfunder.com and in Higher Ed at UCLA and USC speaks to that commitment. At USC in Los Angeles, I also teach computer networking and programming.

  Tasty food, playing a bit of soccer, walking my pup Zoe and leisurely breakfast with my lovely wife are a few of my favorite things.
