###Harrison Cavallero
**I am a software and tech generalist**, from desktop support to systems admin and web development to hadoop I've seen and done it. I am dedicated to effecting social good through business, tech and engineering. My past work at SPINS.com, Destinilocators.com and Crowdfunder.com and in Higher Ed at UCLA and USC speaks to that commitment. At USC in Los Angeles, he also teaches computer networking and programming as part of Viterbi ITP.

Tasty food, playing a bit of soccer, walking my pup Zoe and leisurely breakfast with my lovely wife are a few of my favorite things.

We draw on our personal and professional networks on a per project basis.
